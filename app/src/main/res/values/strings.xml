        Science. It’s harmless and simple enough by itself. See, when I was in elementary school,
        I loved science. I lived for Thursdays because every Thursday my teacher (who wasn’t paid
        nearly enough) donned her lab coat and taught us about animals, plants, volcanoes… Anyway,
        middle school science was much the same as elementary school science, albeit a bit harder.
        It was exhilarating to learn about geology, petrology, plant-ology… Is that a thing? Never
        mind. Plant-ology aside, middle school science was fun. Then I got to high school. That’s
        when it all changed. They decided to put math in science with all its numbers and…
        (frustrated) and letters- pretending-to-be-numbers. Of all the things that they could have
        chosen, math! I complained about it to my dad, and he said that math and science go hand in
        hand. You can’t have one without the other. That’s why I’m not going into the sciences.
