        Science. It\'s harmless and simple enough by itself. See, when I was in elementary school,
        I loved science. I lived for Thursdays because every Thursday my teacher (who wasn\'t paid
        nearly enough) donned her lab coat and taught us about animals, plants, volcanoes… Anyway,
        middle school science was much the same as elementary school science, albeit a bit harder.
        It was exhilarating to learn about geology, petrology, plant-ology… Is that a thing? Never
        mind. Plant-ology aside, middle school science was fun. Then I got to high school. That’s
        when it all changed. They decided to put math in science with all its numbers and…
        (frustrated) and letters- pretending-to-be-numbers. Of all the things that they could have
        chosen, math! I complained about it to my dad, and he said that math and science go hand in
        hand. You can\'t have one without the other. That’s why I\'m not going into the sciences.

        To be, or not to be, that is the question:
        Whether \'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
        The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
        Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
        And by opposing end them. To die—to sleep,
        No more; and by a sleep to say we end
        The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
        That flesh is heir to: \'tis a consummation
        Devoutly to be wish\'d. To die, to sleep;
        To sleep, perchance to dream—ay, there\'s the rub:
        For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,
        When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
        Must give us pause—there\'s the respect
        That makes calamity of so long life.
        For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
        Th\'oppressor\'s wrong, the proud man\'s contumely,
        The pangs of dispriz\'d love, the law\'s delay,
        The insolence of office, and the spurns
        That patient merit of th\'unworthy takes,
        When he himself might his quietus make
        With a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear,
        To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
        But that the dread of something after death,
        The undiscovere\'d country, from whose bourn
        No traveller returns, puzzles the will,
        And makes us rather bear those ills we have
        Than fly to others that we know not of?
        Thus conscience doth make cowards of us all,
        And thus the native hue of resolution
        Is sicklied o\'er with the pale cast of thought,
        And enterprises of great pith and moment
        With this regard their currents turn awry
        And lose the name of action.

        Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;
        I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.
        The evil that men do lives after them;
        The good is oft interred with their bones;
        So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus
        Hath told you Caesar was ambitious:
        If it were so, it was a grievous fault,
        And grievously hath Caesar answer’d it.
        Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest–
        For Brutus is an honourable man;
        So are they all, all honourable men–
        Come I to speak in Caesar’s funeral.
        He was my friend, faithful and just to me:
        But Brutus says he was ambitious;
        And Brutus is an honourable man.
        He hath brought many captives home to Rome
        Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:
        Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?
        When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:
        Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:
        Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
        And Brutus is an honourable man.
        You all did see that on the Lupercal
        I thrice presented him a kingly crown,
        Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?
        Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
        And, sure, he is an honourable man.
        I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,
        But here I am to speak what I do know.
        You all did love him once, not without cause:
        What cause withholds you then, to mourn for him?
        O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,
        And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;
        My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,
        And I must pause till it come back to me.
